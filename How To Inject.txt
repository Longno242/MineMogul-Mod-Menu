HOW TO INJECT
=============

1. Launch MineMogul and wait until you are fully in-game.

2. Open the folder where smi.exe and Mod.dll are located.

3. Click the file directory bar, type "cmd", and press ENTER
   (or Shift + Right Click in the folder and select "Open Command Prompt here").

4. In the Command Prompt window, paste the following command while the game is open:

smi.exe inject -p "MineMogul" -a "Mod.dll" -n Loading -c Loader -m Load


5. Press ENTER and wait for the injection to complete.

6. Once injected, press INSERT in-game to open the mod menu.


NOTES
-----

- Make sure smi.exe and Mod.dll are in the same directory.
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator if injection fails.
- Close and reopen the game if the mod does not appear.

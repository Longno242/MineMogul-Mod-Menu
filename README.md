MineMoguul Mod Menu
==================

An injectable Unity mod menu for MineMoguul, written in C# and injected at runtime using SharpMonoInjector.

This mod adds an in-game GUI that provides movement, visual, ESP, economy, and teleport modifications.


Injection Method
----------------

This mod does NOT use BepInEx.

It is injected directly into MineMoguul’s Mono runtime using SharpMonoInjector.

The loader creates a persistent GameObject and attaches the mod menu, which survives scene changes.
